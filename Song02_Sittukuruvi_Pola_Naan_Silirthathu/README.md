This joyful testimony song traces the journey from childlike delight in God to mature waiting for Christ’s return. The sparrow (Matthew 10:29–31) represents God’s tender care for the humble. Worldly wisdom fades before the surpassing knowledge of Christ (Philippians 3:8). Like David dancing before the ark (2 Samuel 6), we bear God’s presence in our hearts. The song ends in eager hope — Jesus will soon come to take us home.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our coming King,
thank You for every season of joy and waiting.
Let us soar like sparrows in Your care.
Engrave Your covenant on our hearts.
Come quickly and take us home.
We long to wear the crown You give.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
