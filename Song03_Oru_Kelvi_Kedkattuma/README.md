This interactive worship song challenges listeners with direct questions about God’s sovereign works — creation, deliverance, provision, salvation, baptism, victory over sin, the Holy Spirit, and Christ’s return. Every answer points back to the Lord alone. It calls us to look to Him, confess His power, and worship in spirit and truth.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Creator and Redeemer,
open our eyes to see Your hand in all things.
Let every question we ask lead us to one answer: You alone are God.
Come quickly, Lord.
We wait for You.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
