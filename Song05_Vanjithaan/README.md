This powerful warfare song exposes Satan’s age-old strategy of deception — from Eden to Job, from kings to common people, even attempting to tempt Jesus Himself. Yet the song turns to triumphant declaration: Jesus, the God of peace, has crushed Satan (Romans 16:20). The victory is already won and given to every believer. We sing not in fear, but in the authority of the risen Christ.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Victor over Satan,
expose every deception in our hearts.
Crush the enemy under our feet.
Fill us with Your victory song.
Let us walk in the triumph You have won.
Come quickly, conquering King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
