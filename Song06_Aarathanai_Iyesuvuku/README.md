This pure worship anthem lifts every name and title of God revealed in Scripture — from King of kings to the sacred Jehovah names (Provider, Healer, Shepherd, Banner, Peace, the God who is there). It echoes the heavenly worship of Revelation 4–5 and Isaiah 6, calling the believer to unceasing “Hallelujah” praise. The song is simple yet profound — a continual offering of worship to the One who is worthy.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty,
Jesus, King of kings and Lord of lords,
receive this worship rising from our hearts.
Let every name we sing fill us with Your presence.
We worship You alone — now and forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
