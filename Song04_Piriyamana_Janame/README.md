This tender intercessory song echoes 1 Samuel 12:22 — God will not abandon His people for His great name’s sake. From wheat harvest (Ruth), to rejecting the King yet receiving Jesus, to deliverance through Gideon, Samson, Moses, and Aaron — every story shows God’s relentless love despite our fear and failure. The singer stands in the gap, praying for the beloved people, assuring them: “He will never forsake you.”
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our faithful Intercessor,
thank You for never abandoning Your people.
Forgive us when we forget or fear.
Send Your deliverance again.
Let us worship without fear.
Draw us close and never let us go.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
