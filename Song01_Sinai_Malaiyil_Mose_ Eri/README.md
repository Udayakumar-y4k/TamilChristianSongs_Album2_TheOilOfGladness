This song draws parallels between Moses’ encounters with God on Mount Sinai and our call to ascend in prayer and worship today. From parting the sea to sending manna, from raising the dead to conquering sin, every mighty act of God through Moses finds its greater fulfillment in Christ. We are called to climb the “mountains” of prayer, feed others with the Word, and live in resurrection power — until Jesus returns to take us home.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, greater than Moses,
draw us up the mountain of prayer.
Let us meet You face to face.
Feed us with living manna.
Anoint us with Holy Spirit fire.
Help us overcome sin and darkness.
Come quickly and take us home.
We long to worship You forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
