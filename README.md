Album 2: The Oil of Gladness

Freshly anointed Tamil Christian worship songs with English translations.

Joyful songs of ascent, encounter, deliverance, and victory in Christ — flowing from the greater anointing of Jesus, who was anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions (Hebrews 1:9).

All glory to the Lord Jesus Christ.

Companion to Album 1 and the Divine Neural Network revelation.
